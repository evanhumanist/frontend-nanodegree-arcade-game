# Arcade Game
This is Project 3 in the Udacity/Google Frontend Nanodegree course. I was lucky enough to be one of the recipients of a scholarship for this course and I'm super excited to work through all the challenges ahead!

## Dependencies
All that is required is a modern Web Browser (Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Safari, Edge etc...). Several ES6 features are used, but all modern web browsers are compatible.

## Instructions
[navigate here](https://evanhumanist.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/index.html)

Move your character with the arrow keys.

Up - Moves the character up one space

Left - Moves the character left one space

Right - Moves the character right one space

Down - Moves the character down one space

The goal is to move your character all the way up until they reach the water.
